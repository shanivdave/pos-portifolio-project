Keeping your sales and stock data in sync can boost profits and customer satisfaction.

    Inventory management is critical for retailers and restaurants.
    If you choose the right point-of-sale (POS) system for your business, you can effectively manage your inventory.
    Your inventory management is successful if you have fewer mis-shipments, out-of-stocks and dead stock (obsolete or unsellable) items.
    This article is for small business owners interested in implementing a POS system to help with inventory management.

If your business sells physical products, you need to manage inventory. Inefficient inventory management can cause a host of problems, such as high warehousing costs, not having products available for customers, having products in the wrong place and having too much product, forcing you to sell at a discount.

When thinking about inventory management, consider these key components.

    Visibility: Know what you have specifically, and be aware of where your products are located.
    Inventory: Make an educated guess about how much of each item you’ll need to meet demand within a specific time period.
    Purchasing/replenishing: Know when stock must be purchased in order to arrive in time to meet demand.
    Storage: Figure out how much room you have to store inventory, and send your products to an appropriate storage area if necessary.
    Analysis: Understand the data that gives insight into how to order inventory more effectively in the future.
    Multichannel tracking: Allocate inventory levels among physical locations and fulfillment centers for e-commerce orders, and shift inventory as needed.

Who needs inventory management?

Among small and midsize businesses, retailers and restaurants typically have the most need for inventory management. Retailers usually carry various products, many of which have differences in size, material and color. Keeping tabs on all these items — and making sure they’re available when customers are ready to buy — is critical to a business’s success.
Inventory management techniques

Business owners use several inventory management techniques to optimize inventory levels. The most basic technique is perpetual inventory management, which means counting inventory as soon as it arrives and subtracting when items are sold or lost to damage or theft. This system is often combined with demand forecasting, which uses past sales data to anticipate future demand and quantities that should be ordered.

Some companies use just-in-time inventory management to minimize storage costs. This works well when the supply chain is consistent but can cause problems when there is a problem along the way.
How a POS system can help with inventory management

When you set up a POS system with inventory management features, you’ll need to load information about your current products and inventory into the system, including product names, descriptions, categories, supply prices, retail prices, SKU numbers, barcode numbers, quantities and suppliers.

Every time you ring up a sale, the software will automatically adjust the items’ inventory levels. This gives you a number of advantages.

    Automated inventory tracking: This reduces the time employees need to devote to checking on stock and the need for error-prone inventory hand-counting.
    Report generation: See your sales and inventory levels by location or time period to know when to reorder or run a promotion. Valuable POS sales report insights include information on your bestsellers, your slow-moving products, your most profitable products and items that are running low.
    Quick visibility: The system allows employees to quickly see if an item is in stock, providing an easy way to monitor inventory levels and avoid stock-outs.
    Remote management: If your business has multiple locations or channels (e-commerce and brick-and-mortar), the system will allow you to see inventory levels for products in each location and channel without having to go there physically.
    Dynamic inventory management: Better information allows businesses to use inventory management techniques like just-in-time, perpetual inventory, and reorder point to minimize costs and maximize sales.
